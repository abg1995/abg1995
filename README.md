- 👋 Hi, I’m @abg1995
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to program websites and applications 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in a masters of web and app development, but i will soon start also a bootcamp as i want to get started doing stuff and the masters are taking too much time and are always done on your own.
